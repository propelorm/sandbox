/**
 * A simple program to aid in launching chroot/--rbound programs
 * using the original user credentials. This program is supposed to
 * be used with suid-bit set (chmod u+s).
 *
 * Copyright 2007 Aleksandr Koltsoff (czr@iki.fi)
 * Released under the GNU General Public License version 2 (GPL).
 * Please see provided COPYING file or http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.txt
 *
 * 
 * The objective of this program is to:
 * - chroot (argv[1])
 * - change working directory to (argv[2])
 * - switch user credentials back to original (since this was
 *   run via suid-bit)
 * - exec the target program (argv[3]) (we use direct exec)
 *
 * rest of the argv is passed to the target program directly.
 * environment is passed to the target program (without modifications)
 *
 * Parameters:
 * - argv[1]: new-root (must start with abs-path)
 * - argv[2]: new working dir, relative to post-chroot
 * - argv[3]: executable name (related to new working directory) to execve
 * - argv[4+ if any]: additional parameters passed to target executable
 *
 * Never returns success exit code (0), but will return error codes
 * if checks will fail before getting to the execve-part. In that case
 * errors will be print out on stderr.
 *
 * Exit codes:
 * 1: problem with command line arguments (usage printed)
 * 2: no root-privs (won't even attempt to chroot)
 * 3: chroot target does not exist or cannot be accessed with real
 *    UID/GID (non-root) (tested with access(2))
 * 4: chroot-syscall fails
 * 5: cd / fails (post chroot)
 * 6: dropping privileges failed
 * 7: no X_OK on the target (just before execve)
 * 8: execve failed
 * 9: somehow execve returned even if it didn't fail (impossible)
